# SEIFA
.id Developer Coding Challenge

Created in Visual Studio 2017 with .Net Core 2.1 (MVC and EF) and MSSQLLocalDB

Database Note: Make sure that (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB exists in the "SQL Server Object Explorer" Window.

Implementation Note: Most of the logic can be found in DbDataService.cs.

Bootstrap was initially chosen for the View but requirements did not state any specific UI/UX elements so plain HTML is used.
